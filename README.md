# TheHolySpiritFoundation
The Holy Spirit Foundation is dedicated to ending debt bondage and freeing slaves around the world.

## Our Mission

Our faith-based organization is led by the Holy Spirit. We seek to empower individuals  and communities affected by debt bondage and other forms of slavery by paying off their debts and  providing support to help them achieve freedom and flourishing. Grounded in our faith and guided by the values of justice, compassion, and  mercy, we work to restore dignity and hope to those who have been  trapped in bondage. Through collaboration with local and international partners, and a  commitment to transparency and accountability, we strive to create a lasting impact and transform lives. Our ultimate goal is to see all people living in freedom and fullness of life, as our Heavenly Father intended.

## Guiding Principles

### Human Dignity

We recognize the inherent dignity of all mankind, as the Lord has commanded us:

*"Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all who are destitute. Open your mouth, judge righteously, defend the rights of the poor and needy."* **Proverbs 31:89**

### Non-Discrimination

We do not discriminate in who we help, as the Apostle Paul said,

*"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus."* **Galatians 3:28**

### Transparency

We have a commitment of 100% transparency in our operations, finances, and decision-making processes, as it is written

*"The integrity of the upright guides them, but the crookedness of the treacherous destroys them."* **Proverbs 11:3**

### Accountability

We know that we will be held to account for all of our actions, not only to man, but to the Lord,

*"Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God."* **Romans 3:19**

### Integrity

We hold ourselves to the perfect standards of our Lord because it is only through that which righteousness may abound. 

*"The integrity of the upright guides them, but the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity."* **Proverbs 11:3**

### Sustainability

We know that people need more than just a one-time hand out, that is why we are dedicated to creating and growing sustainable communities for those who escape bondage.

*"The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance, but everyone who is hasty comes only to poverty."* **Proverbs 21:5**

### Collaboration

We know this is not a one-man or one organization job. What we seek to do requires a communal effort to effect systematic change in the world, and it requires us to work diligently with others. 

*"Though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him - a threefold cord is not quickly broken."* **Ecclesiastes 4:12**

### Cultural Sensitivity

We work with people and cultures from every clime and place, and that requires a great deal of awareness and respect for others' cultures.

*"And it shall come to pass int he place where it was said to them, 'you are not My people.' There they shall be called sons of the living God."* **Romans 9:26**

### Environmental Responsibility

Wherever humans go, we have an impact. Part of our work on this Earth is stewarding the planet our Heavenly Father left us, so when we build and establish communities, we will make sure to do so in a manner which does not harm the land, as it is written,

*"You shall not pollute the land in which you live, for blood polluts the land, and no atonement can be made for the land for the blood that is shed in it, except by the blood of the one who shed it."* **Numbers 35:33**

### Safeguarding

It is unfortunate, but true, that in many places around the world, particularly in those places where help is needed the most, violence, war, and corruption are all common. We go to great lengths to protect our beneficiaries, volunteers, staff, and communities.   

*â€œWhen a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are safe."* **Luke 11:21**
